<p><strong>Domain adaptation</strong></p>

<p>The incredible success of deep learning shows the potential of artificial
intelligence to learn from complex large-scale whole-genome data in
computational biology. However, it can be extremely expensive or time-consuming
to collect and annotate data in biology. In the lack of sufficient data,
biologists always leverage probabilistic modeling to generate datasets. However,
deep learning-based attempts using simulated datasets always struggle with model misspecification, as real data often has additional noise which is not
well-characterized in probabilistic modeling. Our ongoing work is focusing on
proposing new domain adaptation methods to fill the gap between probabilistic
modeling and real data.</p>
