Topics include parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, statistical tests (parametric and non parametric) and linear regression (single and multiple).  Reviewing materials had been included in slides since the week of March 10 when in-person classes were cancelled at Berkeley because of COVID-19. Lab 7 included a thorough review of part 1 \u0026amp; 2 (i.e., parametric estimation and hypothesis testing). From Lab 7 onwards, you can find the reviewing materials in each lab by its title.\nThe following slides and all other teaching materials were made by me, so I take responsibility for any typo. The problem sets in the slides were from previous iterations of the class.\nMaterials  Lab 1: R setup and practice [Slides]  Part 1: Parametric Estimation\n  Lab 2: MoM, nonparametric bootstrap, SE calculation [Slides]\n  Lab 3: MLE, Delta method [Slides]\n  Lab 4: Quiz 1 recap, Fisher information, CRLB, MSE, ggplot [Slides]\n  Lab 5: Sufficiency, minimal sufficiency, Rao-Blackwell theorem [Slides]\n  Part 2: Hypothesis Testing\n  Lab 6: Hypothesis testing, Neyman-Pearson lemma, LRT, UMP test, GLRT, p value [Slides]\n  Lab 7: Midterm Review [Slides]\n  Part 3: Statistical Tests (parametric \u0026amp; nonparametric)\n  Lab 8: 2-sample t-test, chi-squared test [Slides]\n  Lab 9: TOH, TOI, Mann-Whitney test [Slides]\n  Lab 10: Wilcoxon signed rank test, ANOVA, Bonferroni correction [Slides]\n  Part 4: Linear Regression (single \u0026amp; multiple)\n  Lab 11: Bonferroni t-test, Kruskal Willis test, review of statistical tests, linear regression with its R implimentation [Slides] [R demo]\n  Lab 12: Statistical properties for least squares estimation [Slides] [R soln]\n  Lab 13: Multiple linear regression, prediction interval, Bayesian statistics [Slides] [R demo]\n  ","date":1590105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590105600,"objectID":"79bcae35c50484d046593819d583f923","permalink":"http://yu-tong-wang.github.io/teaching/courses/stat135/","publishdate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/courses/stat135/","section":"Teaching","summary":"Prof: Adam Lucas","tags":null,"title":"Statistics 135: Concepts of Statistics (Spring 2020)","type":"teaching"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Course Information  Professor: Cari Kaufman Office Hours: W, F 9-11am @ 426 Evans Lab Sections: M, W 12-1pm @285 Cory; M, W 1-2pm @332 Evans Content: STAT 2 is Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s introductory-level course on statistics for undergraduates.
