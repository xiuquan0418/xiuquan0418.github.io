Three main themes of the course will be spatial transcriptomics, integrative analysis of multi-omics data, and immune receptor-antigen interactions. In addition to reading a number of recent research articles in these areas, students will be provided with an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in analyzing real data.  Check out my lecture slides about spatial transcriptomics, and two problem sets I created about spatial transcriptomics data analysis as well as multi-omics integration analysis respectively.

To better understand how individual cells function within an anatomical space, we developed XYZeq, a workflow that encodes spatial metadata into scRNA-seq libraries. We used XYZeq to profile mouse tumor models to capture spatially barcoded transcriptomes from tens of thousands of cells. Analyses of these data revealed the spatial distribution of distinct cell types and a cell migration-associated transcriptomic program in tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Furthermore, we identify localized expression of tumor suppressor genes by MSCs that vary with proximity to the tumor core. We demonstrate that XYZeq can be used to map the transcriptome and spatial localization of individual cells in situ to reveal how cell composition and cell states can be affected by location within complex pathological tissue.","tags":[],"title":"XYZeq: Spatially-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals expression heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"443ba1582dc4811a9c20089ef25fb885","permalink":"http://yu-tong-wang.github.io/teaching/index_/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/index_/","section":"Teaching","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Teaching","type":"Teaching"}]
