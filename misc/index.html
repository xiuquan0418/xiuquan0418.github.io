			<p>I have been working as a journalist in the <a href="http://www.xingongmin.org.cn/">New Citizen Program</a> in China since 2016, to raise sexual health
awareness of the public, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-behind_children_in_China">left-behind children</a> in particular.
I later realized credible statistics of domestic sexual crime is impossibly difficult to collect in my home country. Thus I&rsquo;ve been consistently interested in data collection and statistical analysis about related social issues for the sake of public policy-making.</p>

<p>I have published several articles as a journalist. Here are some excerpts from my previous work in Chinese.</p>
