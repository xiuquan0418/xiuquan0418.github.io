			<p>In 2016 - 2017, I was working as a volunteer journalist in the <a href="http://www.xingongmin.org.cn/">New Citizen Program</a> in China to raise the sexual health awareness of the public, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-behind_children_in_China">left-behind children</a> in particular. Because of the insufficient educational resource and improper custody, these children are more vulnerable to safety and mental health problems. Sexism, unprotected sex, unintended pregnancy, improper induced abortion, and sexual harassment in particular, made sexual health education of left-behind children a national imperative.</p>

<p>There is a big issue with collecting credible statistics of domestic sexual crime. The only data released by the National Bureau of Statistics was the total number of criminal sex-abuse cases in 2013 and 2014. I&rsquo;m highly interested in collecting data
and performing statistical analysis to contribute to corresponding public policy-making.</p>

<p>I also published several articles in Chinese as a journalist, Here are some excerpts
from my previous work.</p>
